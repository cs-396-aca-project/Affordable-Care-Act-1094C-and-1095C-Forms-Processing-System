<h1>Affordable Care Act System</h1>
  <br>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide employee health insurance. Part of this includes completion of forms 1094C and 1095C, and for employers with more than 200 employees an XML based report must also be submitted.</p>
  <p>Our team wanted to develop a processing system that manages the PDF and XML publications to support the Affordable Care Act. All the members in our team are taking CS-342 at Calvin University, so we are confident that weâ€™ll be able to learn the necessary skills needed in creating a database system. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Current Status</h2> 
  <p>We ave our prototype which is an xml prototype for the 1094/1095 form to show how our XML should look like when we convert the PDF form and data from the database to an XML.</p>
